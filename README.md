## Project Overview

The **[playlist manager app]** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [HAW1] subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to store songs details and allow user to create and manage playlist
The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to [store songs details allow the user to create and add songs also manage the app]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: [user friendly to user not difficult]
- Feature 2: [added crash proof in the mainactivity]
- Feature 3: [Exit Button: Allows users to close the application.]

These features aim to provide [].

## Design Considerations

The design of the **[App Title]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
